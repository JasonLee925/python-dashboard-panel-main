### Interactive visualization dashboard in Python with Panel

This project is copied from [python-dashboard-panel](https://github.com/thu-vu92/python-dashboard-panel).

I studied this project for learning purpose and tried to rewrite it without using pipeline since it slows down the rendering process (For the scatter plot in this project especially).
